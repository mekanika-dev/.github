---

We design open-source CNC milling machines, screen printing presses, and accessories. Built in Brussels, used by makers all over the world. Our mission is to make local production more accessible through quality machines, shared knowledge, and community-driven innovation.

### What's Inside Each Repo

Every machine and accessory repository follows the same structure:

```
bom/   →  Bill of Materials (CSV, synced from our ERP)
cad/   →  3D assembly files in STEP format
docs/  →  Documentation and reference files
```

> **Note:** CAD files use **Git LFS** — make sure you have it installed before cloning.  
> BOMs can also be browsed via our [web viewer](https://mekanika-dev.github.io/data-sync-actions/odoo/bom-viewer.html). STEP files can be previewed directly in the browser through links provided in each repo's README.

### Community & Contributing

We believe in collaborative design. Whether you're an engineer, a maker, or just curious, we welcome:

- **Design contributions** — improve existing machines or propose modifications
- **Feedback** — share your experience, report issues, suggest improvements
- **Discussions** — ask questions, share projects, and connect with other users

Join us on **[Discord](https://discord.gg/n7RsBtUdGc)** to chat with the community and our team.

All hardware projects are licensed under the **[CERN Open Hardware Licence v2 — Strongly Reciprocal (CERN-OHL-S)](https://ohwr.org/cern_ohl_s_v2.pdf)**.  
You are free to study, modify, and distribute the designs — as long as you share your modifications under the same terms.
